# How to Contribute
- [sign up here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/sign_up)
- fork the repo using the `Fork` button in the top right
- clone your fork of the repo using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/hacktoberithms`
- go to the `Issues` tab on the repo and view the incomplete challenges
- create a new branch for your solution `git checkout -b issue_number-solution`
- work on a solution to the challenge
- commit your work (dont forget to add commit messages) using `git commit -m "your commit message"` or the VSC built-in utility
- push your work up to your forked repo using
  - `git push -u origin issue_number-solution`
    - the `-u` flag will set the upstream branch on your forked repo so future pushes do not need the remote or branch name
  - `git push` if you have already set the upstream branch
- open a pull request to merge your branch solution into this repo
  - go to your branch on your forked repo
  - hit the `New Pull Request` button next to the branch name on GitHub
  - choose `Base fork: the-vampiire/hacktoberithms`
  - write a pull request message that describes your approach, anything you were stuck on and solved, and instructions on how to use the solution

# Other ways to contribute
- open a new Issue with an algorithm problem so someone else can solve it
